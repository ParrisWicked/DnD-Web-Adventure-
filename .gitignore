.gitignore
This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore and not commit to your repository. It's crucial for keeping your project clean and secure by preventing unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked.

# Node modules
node_modules/

# Environment variables
.env

# Game logs
logs/

# Operating System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Editor-specific files (e.g., VS Code)

# Build artifacts (if any are generated in the future outside of node_modules)
dist/

# npm debug logs
npm-debug.log*
.npm/
.yarn-integrity
